## Project Summary
📖 A short project on LangChain: Chat With Your Data! Explore two main topics: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and building a chatbot. Unlock the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to retrieve contextual documents and create chatbots that respond using your own data. 


You'll learn about:
1. 📥 **Document Loading**: Access over 80 unique loaders provided by LangChain to handle various data sources, including audio and video.
